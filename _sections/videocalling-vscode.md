### Overview

GitLive's video-calling feature allows you to video call teammates straight from your IDE and work together on files exactly like you would in a Google Doc. This feature will undoubtedly boost your productivity when you want to fix code issues with a teammate.


### Instructions
#### Step 1

 Access the feature by clicking the phone icon next to your teammate's name.

#### Step 2

 You will then get a pop-up notification that you have sent the request to collaborate and are waiting for your teammate to accept.

#### Step 3

The teammate you are looking to collaborate with (the host) will then get a pop-up notification that you request to collaborate.

As with all GitLive features, real-time editing works interoperably between supported IDEs!
