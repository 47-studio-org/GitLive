<br>

- ### **The future of social coding**

 **Connect.** See when your fellow contributors are online and which repos, branches and files they are working on. <br>
 **Automated.** Connect your issue tracker to share what issue you are working on based on your current branch.


<br>

- ### **Resolve conflicts before they happen**

 **Live.** See others' local changes in the gutter of your editor and get notified the moment you make a conflicting change. <br>
 **Patch.** View diffs of other contributors' local files and cherryâ€‘pick individual lines, files or complete working copies.

<br>

- ### **Code together in real-time**

 **Codeshare.** Make voice and video calls directly from your editor and codeshare to see each others cursors. <br>
 **Agnostic.** Edit together simultaneously, interoperable between VS Code and all JetBrains IDEs.

## Contributing to GitLive
We're a tool built for developers, by developers. So your contributions are important to us! Please review this section to make the process of contributing as smooth and efficient as possible.

### Reporting an Issue
GitLive uses [Github Issue Tracking](https://github.com/GitLiveApp/gitlive/issues) to track issues (mainly bugs). If you've found a bug, this is the place to start.
1. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue.
1. Search the current issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
1. If it hasn't, you can [Open a new Issue](https://github.com/GitLiveApp/gitlive/issues/new).
   1. Please include as much information as possible - a title and a clear description at the very least.


### Feature Requests
Feature requests are welcome. But please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project, and provide as much detail as you can.

### Improving the Documentation
If there are any improvements you would like to see to our documentation, you can also use the Github issue tracking system. Our documentation is all open source, so if there are any improvements you would like to make yourself, you can do so via a pull request, which we will then review.

### Serving your Changes Locally

Install the bundler if you don't have it already.
```bash
gem install bundler
```

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
bundle install
```

Run the following to serve the site locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now you will be able to view your changes locally by going to:
```bash
http://localhost:4000
```

You can find more on [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
