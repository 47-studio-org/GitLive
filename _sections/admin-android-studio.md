### Overview

In this quick guide you will learn how to install the GitLive app on your repository hosting service as an administrator.

### Steps for authenticating

As an administrator, you are required to install the GitLive app on the organization or account level and grant it access to the repositories that you would like to use GitLive with.

### Step 1

* Install the plugin as explained in the [installation section](/){:class="internal-link"}
* Open up a clone of the repository that you want to use GitLive with.

### Step 2

* Sign in with your repository hosting service to authenticate yourself.

### Step 4

* You will also have the option to add an issue tracker to GitLive. If you choose not to connect an issue tracker, you can do this at a later date through the settings menu. You will have the option to connect the issue tracker attached to your repository hosting service or to Jira. In this case, since GitLive was set up on a Github organisation, the options are to slect Github issues or Jira.

### Step 5

* Once you have installed the GitLive app on your repository hosting service, you will see your team in the GitLive window. If they haven't installed GitLive yet, their names will be greyed out.
