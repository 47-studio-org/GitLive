### Overview

GitLive's video-calling feature allows you to video call teammates straight from your IDE and work together on files exactly like you would in a Google Doc. This feature will undoubtedly boost your productivity when you want to fix code issues with a teammate.


### Instructions
#### Step 1

 Next to a collaborators name, you will find a phone icon allowing you to place a call with them when clicked, once on the call you can also edit code together.

You can also call any collaborator through the command palette. First select “Call a Teammate” and you will have a dropdown list of all of your collaborators on the project.

#### Step 2

 You will then get a pop-up notification that you have sent the request to call and are waiting for your teammate to accept.

#### Step 3

The teammate you are looking to call will then get a pop-up notification.

#### Calling Features

There are four main controls available whilst on the call. You can choose to mute yourself, to enable or disable video, to screenshare or codeshare.

<table class="table-custom">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/mute-mic-option.jpg" alt="Mute Mic Option">
            </td>
    <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/enable-video-option.jpg" alt="Enable Video Option">
            </td>
        <tr>
            <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/share-screen-option.jpeg" alt="Share Code Option">
            </td>
            <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/share-code-option.jpg" alt="Share Screen Option">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As with all GitLive features, real-time editing works interoperably between supported IDEs!
