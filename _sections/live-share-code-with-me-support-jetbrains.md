Once you have selected a project you will be prompted to switch back to your IDE.

You will then be prompted to accept your teammateâ€™s request to join.

Once accepted, the session starts!

#### Joining a Code With Me Session 

Once the host starts codesharing via Code With Me and you have a JetBrains IDE already open you will see a prompt to switch to that IDE window.

Any notifications relating to the codeshare will appear in your IDE window.

Your teammate's project will then open in a new IDE window and you are good to go!

If you didn't have a JetBrains IDE already open you will be prompted to open the sharing link in the browser instead.

From here you can open any JetBrains IDE if you already have one installed or even join via the browser.

#### Switiching from GitLive code share to Code With Me

Sharing with the built-in codeshare and then realise you need the extra power of Code With Me? No problem, you can switch from the built-in codeshare to Code With Me at any time in the IDE.
