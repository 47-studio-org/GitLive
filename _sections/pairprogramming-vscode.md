### Overview

GitLive's real-time editing allows you to open a teammateâ€™s file and start editing it exactly like you would in a Google Doc. This feature will undoubtedly boost your productivity when you want to fix code issues with a teammate.

### Pre- Requisites

In order to collaborate with a teammate you need have access to the same repository as the teammate you wish to collaborate with. If they open a file from another repository the live session will pause until they return to a common repository file.

### Instructions
#### Step 1

 Access the feature by clicking the pen icon next to your teammates name and selecting "Collaborate on their files" (you will be the guest).

#### Step 2

 You will then get a popup notifying you that you have sent the request to collaborate and are waiting for your teammate to accept.

#### Step 3

The teammate you are looking to collaborate with (the host) will then get a popup to notify them of your request to collaborate.

As with all GitLive features, real-time editing works interoperably between supported IDEs!
