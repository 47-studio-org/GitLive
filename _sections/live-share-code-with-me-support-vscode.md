If you are using Live Share and you haven't signed in yet, you will be prompted to sign in.

 Once your teammate has accepted on their end you are good to go!

#### Sharing with GitLive

Sharing with the built-in codeshare and then realise you need the extra power of Live Share? No problem, you can switch from the built-in codeshare to Live Share at anytime in VS Code.

#### Joining a Live Share Session 

When your teammates starts codesharing via LiveShare or CodeWithMe and you have a compatible IDE already open you will see a prompt to switch to that IDE window.

Then your teammate's project will open in a new IDE window and you are good to go!

If you didn't have a compatible IDE already open you will be prompted to open the sharing link in the browser instead.

From here you can open a compatible IDE if you already have one installed or even join via the browser.
