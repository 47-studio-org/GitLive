#### Starting a Code With Me Session 

To start a Code With Me session, you should select the Code With Me tab on the Share Code popup modal, and select the project you would like to share.

Once you have selected a project you will be prompted to switch back to your IDE.

You will then be prompted to accept your teammateâ€™s request to join.

 Once your teammate has accepted on their end you are good to go!

#### Sharing with GitLive

Sharing with the built-in codeshare and then realise you need the extra power of Code With Me? No problem, you can switch from the built-in codeshare to Code With Me at any time in the IDE.

#### Joining a Code With Me Session 

When your teammate starts codesharing via LiveShare or CodeWithMe and you have a compatible IDE already open you will see a prompt to switch to that IDE window.

Here you'll see any notifications regarding joining the codeshare.

Then your teammate's project will open in a new IDE window and you are good to go!

If you didn't have a compatible IDE already open you will be prompted to open the sharing link in the browser instead.

![Accept Code With Me](/uploads/codeshare-accept-codewithme.jpg "Accept Code With Me"){:class="screenshot"}


From here you can open a compatible IDE if you already have one installed or even join via the browser.
