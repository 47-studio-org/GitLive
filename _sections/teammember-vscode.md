### Overview

In this quick guide you will learn how to authenticate GitLive in VS Code as a team member.

### Steps for authenticating

* If the admin of your repository has not granted GitLive access to the repository, ask your administrator to follow the steps as shown in the [as an admin](/docs/admin){:class="internal-link"} section.

### Step 1

* Install the plugin as explained in the [installation section](/){:class="internal-link"}.
* Open up a clone of the repository that you want to use GitLive with.

### Step 2

* You will be asked to authenticate with the repository hosting service.

### Step 3

* Return to Visual Studio Code. If the admin of the repository has followed the guidelines in the [setting up as an admin section](/docs/admin){:class="internal-link"}, your team should be now visible. If they have not done this yet, direct them to the [setting up as an admin section](/docs/admin){:class="internal-link"}.
