### Overview

GitLive's cherry picking feature builds on live diff views by allowing developers to cherry pick uncommitted code from their teammates.

Click on your teammateâ€™s working copy and select the cherry icon. You can then enter a commit message and stage the changes that you have just copied for commit on your branch straight away.
