### Pre-requisites

In order to use GitLive, you are required to use a repository hosting service that we support. These are currently GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and Azure DevOps.

If you are unfamiliar with repository hosting services please read [Github's help section](https://help.github.com/en) in order to get familiar with it.

Clone any of your desired repositories and open them in your IDE.

## As an administrator

As an Administrator, you need to grant access to the desired repositories you want to use the GitLive plugin/extension with. This requires installing the GitLive app on your organization level or account level.

If you are using a cloud repository hosting service (e.g. Github), proceed to the [setup guide for administrators (Cloud Repository Hosting)](/docs/admin) to install the GitLive app on your repository hosting service. If you are using a self-hosted repository, proceed to the [setup guide for administrators (Self-Hosted Repository)](/docs/admin-self-hosted)

After installing the GitLive app on your repository hosting service, ask your team members to install the plugin in their respective IDEs and authenticate with GitLive as shown in the [setup guide for team members](/docs/teammember).

## As a team member

Given that the Admin of your repository has followed the instructions as in the [setup guide for administrators](/docs/admin), an individual team member needs to authenticate with his repository hosting service. Open the cloned repository in your IDE and authenticate with your repository hosting service as demonstrated in the [setup guide for team members](/docs/teammember).
