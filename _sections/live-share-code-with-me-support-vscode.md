#### Starting a Live Share Session 
If you have the Live Share extension installed on VS Code, you have the option of using Live Share to pair program on your call. To start a Live Share session, you should select the Live Share tab on the Share Code popup modal, and select the project you would like to share.

Once you have selected a project you will be prompted to switch back to your IDE.

If you are using Live Share and you haven't signed in yet, you will be prompted to sign in.

 Once you have signed in, you are good to go!

#### Joining a Live Share Session 

When your teammate starts codesharing via LiveShare or CodeWithMe and you have a compatible IDE already open you will see a prompt to switch to that IDE window.

Here you'll see any notifications regarding joining the codeshare.

Then your teammate's project will open in a new IDE window and you are good to go!

If you didn't have a compatible IDE already open you will be prompted to open the sharing link in the browser instead.

From here you can open a compatible IDE if you already have one installed or even join via the browser.

#### Switiching from GitLive code share to Live Share

Sharing with the built-in codeshare and then realise you need the extra power of Live Share? No problem, you can switch from the built-in codeshare to Live Share at any time in VS Code.
