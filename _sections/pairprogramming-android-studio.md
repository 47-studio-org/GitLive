### Overview

GitLive's real-time editing allows you to open a teammateâ€™s file and start editing it exactly like you would in a Google Doc. This feature will undoubtedly boost your productivity when you want to fix code issues with a teammate.

### Pre- Requisites

In order to collaborate with a teammate you need the same repository in your current project as the teammate you wish to collaborate with. If they open a file from another repository the live session will pause until they return to a common project file.

### Instructions
#### Step 1

 Access the feature by right clicking your teammate's name and selecting "Collaborate on their files" (you will be the guest).

#### Step 2

 The teammate you are looking to collaborate with (the host) will then get a pop-up notification of your request to collaborate.

#### Step 3

 If the host misses the pop-up notification sent by Android Studio, they can still view the request in their event log.

As with all GitLive features, real-time editing works interoperably between supported IDEs!
