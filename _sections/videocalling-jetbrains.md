### Overview

GitLive's video-calling feature allows you to video call teammates straight from your IDE and work together on files exactly like you would in a Google Doc. This feature will undoubtedly boost your productivity when you want to fix code issues with a teammate.


### Instructions
#### Step 1

 Next to a collaborators name, you will find a phone icon allowing you to place a call with them when clicked, once on the call you can also edit code together.

You can also call any collaborator through the “Search Everywhere” list. You can access your contact list from the actions tab of the “Search Everywhere” list.

#### Calling Features

There are four main controls available whilst on the call. You can choose to mute yourself, to enable or disable video, to screenshare or codeshare.

    <tr>
    <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/mute-mic-option.jpg" alt="Mute Mic Option">
            </td>
    <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/enable-video-option.jpg" alt="Enable Video Option">
            </td>
        <tr>
            <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/share-screen-option.jpeg" alt="Share Code Option">
            </td>
            <td class="td-custom">
              <img src="/uploads/share-code-option.jpg" alt="Share Screen Option">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


#### CodeShare

Selecting the share code option starts a collaboration session in your IDE. This means that any file you open will also open in the IDE of the other participant on the call, allowing you to edit together as you would in a google doc.

By default you will automatically follow each others cursors when scrolling or switching files, you can disable following from within the IDE to work independently.

#### ScreenShare

You have the option to share your screen with the other participant on the call, which can be useful if you need to share content from your browser or terminal for example. You can share a specific window or your entire desktop.

![Screenshare](/uploads/video-calling-receiver-screen.png "Screenshare"){:class="screenshot"}

#### Enable Video

When you first join a call, it will default to an audio call. At any point, any participant can choose to turn on their video to begin a video call.

![Enable Video](/uploads/video-calling-videos.jpeg "Enable Video"){:class="screenshot"}

#### Mute Microphone

If you choose to mute your microphone, other users will see the mute icon next to your name, so that they are aware of the fact that your microphone has been muted.

#### Ending the Call

Once the call has been ended, a message will appear notifying both participants. At this point, you can close the tab in your browser and return to your IDE.

![End Call](/uploads/video-call-ended.jpg "End Call"){:class="screenshot"}
