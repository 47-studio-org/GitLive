### Overview

In this quick guide you will learn how to authenticate GitLive on any JetBrains IDE as a team member.

### Steps for authenticating

* If the admin of your repository has not granted GitLive access to the repository, request your administrator to follow the steps as shown in the [as an admin](docs/admin){:class="internal-link"} section.

### Step 1

* Install the plugin as explained in the [installation section](/){:class="internal-link"}
* Open up a clone of the repository that you want to use GitLive with.

### Step 2

* You will be asked to authenticate with the repository hosting service.

### Step 3

* Return to your IDE and if the admin on the repository you are working on has followed the guidelines ([setting up as an admin section](/docs/admin){:class="internal-link"}), your team should appear. If they haven't done this yet, direct them to the [setting up as an admin section](/docs/admin){:class="internal-link"}.
