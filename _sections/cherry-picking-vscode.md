### Overview

GitLive's cherry picking feature builds on live diff views, [shown in the visibility section](/docs/visibility){:class="internal-link"}, by allowing developers to cherry pick unpushed code from their teammates.

Click on your teammateâ€™s working copy and select the cherry icon. Once you cherry pick, your local changes will be overwritten by your teammate's changes, and you will have those changes in your local copy. On VS Code, these changes will get to be added to your staged changes, at this point, you can choose to commit these changes.
