### Overview

GitLive comes with privacy settings to give users more granular control over the information they want to share. Here we take you through some of the different settings users can enable to ensure privacy when not collaborating or when they require it.

### Privacy Settings

There are three main privacy settings. Users can appear offline, hide their activity graph, or hide changes they have made to files.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Functionality</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Offline Mode</td>
            <td>
                When enabled you will appear as offline
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hide activity graph</td>
            <td>
                When enabled your activity graph will not appear for your team
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hide my working copy changes</td>
            <td>
                When enabled your local file changes will not appear for you or your team
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Offline Mode

In the screenshots below **vinoduec** is initially online, shown by the white dot next to his name. Once he activates the offline mode, **vinoduec** appears as if he is offline.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/vscode-privacy-normal.png">
            </td>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/vscode-privacy-offline.png">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Hide Activity Graph

Although the activity graph feature is not available on VSCode, if any of your colleagues use a Jetbrains IDE, they will be able to see your activity graph, and you can choose to hide your activity graph whenever you wish.
On the left, the activity graph for  **Ismael Juma** is visible and shows that he's been active recently. However, on the right-hand side, the activity graph is hidden.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/jetbrains-privacy-normal.png">
            </td>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/jetbrains-privacy-hide-activity-graph.png">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Hide my Working Copy Changes

On the left, GitLive shows that  **vinoduec** has made some changes to the **Spark** repository. Specifically, he has added some lines to **utils.js**, among other files . On the right-hand side, all of these working copy changes are hidden from view.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/vscode-working-copy-before.png">
            </td>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/vscode-working-copy-hide.png">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
