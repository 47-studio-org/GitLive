### Overview

GitLive comes with privacy settings to give users more granular control over the information they want to share. Here we take you through some of the different settings users can enable to ensure privacy when not collaborating or when they require it.

### Privacy Settings

There are three main privacy settings. Users can appear offline, hide their activity graph, or hide changes they have made to files.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Functionality</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Offline Mode</td>
            <td>
                When enabled you will appear as offline
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hide activity graph</td>
            <td>
                When enabled your activity graph will not appear for you or your team
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hide my working copy changes</td>
            <td>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Offline Mode

In the screenshots below **SuDa2103** is initially online, shown by the green dot next to his name. Once he activates the offline mode, **SuDa2103** appears as if he is offline.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/android-studio-privacy-normal.jpeg">
            </td>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/android-studio-privacy-offline.jpeg">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Hide Activity Graph

On the left, the activity graph for  **SuDa2103** is visible and shows that he's been active recently. However, on the right-hand side, the activity graph is hidden.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/android-studio-privacy-normal.jpeg">

    </tbody>
</table>

### Hide my Working Copy Changes

On the left, GitLive shows that  **SuDa2103** has made some changes to the **Sample Repo** repository. Specifically, he has added some lines to the **BlueFalcon.kt** file. On the right-hand side, all of these working copy changes are hidden from view.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
              <img class="screenshot" src="/uploads/android-studio-working-copy-before.jpeg">
            </td>
            <td>
