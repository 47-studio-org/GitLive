### Overview

GitLive's cherry picking feature builds on live diff views by allowing developers to cherry pick uncommitted code from their teammates.

Click on your teammate’s working copy , right click and select the cherry pick option. Once you accept the changes, you will have your teammate’s changes in your local copy.
