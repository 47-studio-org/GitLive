### Overview

GitLive's cherry picking feature builds on live diff views, [shown in the visibility section](/docs/visibility){:class="internal-link"}, by allowing developers to cherry pick unpushed code from their teammates.

Click on your teammateâ€™s working copy and select the cherry icon. On VS Code, these changes will get to be added to your staged changes, it is up to you to unstage or keep them staged.
